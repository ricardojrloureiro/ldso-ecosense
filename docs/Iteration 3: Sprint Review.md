# Iteration 3: Sprint Review

## What has been done

During this week's sprint the team was able to complete every single item from the Project Backlog that were intended for this specific sprint. The team completed all the estimated users stories for a total of 10 points, keeping the project in line with the initial plan.  As mentioned before this Sprint was a success meaning all the intended items were completed. Those being:
* As a company I can delete a post so that I can remove unwanted content.
* As an administrator I can delete any content so that there is no inappropriate content.
* As a company I can edit a post so that I can fix information.
* As a user I want to report problems regarding ecological issues near me so that I can raise awareness.
* As a user I want to share company's posts on my profile so others can see which practices I like.
* As a user I want to read my social responsibilities feed using my phone so that I can get updated on the go
Additionally the problems with Android Studio from the last iteration have been addressed and the app is now in development.


## What could be improved

The communication with the Product Owner, due to computer issues,  is still not on point which definitely a set back. However the team has worked based on the previous comunication between the SPO and the PO over time and is actively completing the estabilished backlog items while waiting for a response from the PO.

## What actions will we take to improve?

The group will continue making an effort to improve the communication with the PO, being that it would be beneficial for both parts. Additionally we will continue on working on an easy and accessible way to set up a always-on server, instead of a Vagrant Share, so the Product Owner can review and give feedback on the progress as it is happening.
