#Iteration 2: Sprint Review

##What has been done

During this iteration the team completed all the estimated users stories for a total of 12 points, keeping the project in line with the initial plan.

##What could be improved

The communication with the Product Owner is still not on point which is setting back some of the US acceptances.
Additionally, there have been some issues installing Android Studio which set has also caused some set backs that were fixed by the end of the sprint.

##What actions will we take to improve?

The group will work on actively contact the Product Owner and also set up a always-on server, instead of a Vagrant Share, so the Product Owner can review and give feedback on the progress as it is happening.
