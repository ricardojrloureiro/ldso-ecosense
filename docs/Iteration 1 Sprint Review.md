# Iteration 1: Sprint Review

## What has been done

During this week's sprint the team was able to complete every single item from the Project Backlog that were intended for this specific sprint. After a brief change of ideas with the Project Owner the team created and ordered the project's Backlog in a way we believe is concise and will allow us to achieve the project's final goals. 
As mentioned before this Sprint was a success meaning all the intended items were completed. Those being:

* As a company I want to register the company's profile so I can share our social responsibilities.
* As a user I want to register an account so I can follow social responsibility companies practice. 
* As a visitor I want to visit any user's profile so that I can know his preferences.
* As a company I want to categorize our practices so users can browse them.
* As a user I want to manage my profile so that I can keep it up to date.

## About the Sprint

As mentioned before the sprint went well being that the only problem that arose was the PO not being able comunicate with the team due to computer issues, that even though are now fixed, wasn't able to attend the meeting being that the review is solely based on the comunication between the SPO and the PO over time and the completion of the estabilished backlog items. As for the team itself no real problems arose besides a minor misunderstanding of how the companies (as users) worked, however the issue was properly adressed being that the project owner was contacted and enlighted the concept so that the team could work on it.

## Final Discussion

With the previous agenda items now being complete this affects the next items on the Backlog positively since they are ordered in order of dependency and means the team is on schedule. According to the Backlog and if the current speed and team's efficiency are maintained the team is due to complete the project it was set out to complete in time as long as there are no unexpected occurences. All the implemented features have been sent to the Project Owner who so far has been satisfied with the work. 
Next is the Sprint Planning Meeting which is already on track since the next sprint's items have been reviewed by the project owner.
